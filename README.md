My name’s Kashyap Challapalli, I’m a current student studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at University of Colorado Boulder. I’m super interested in [Trifecta], Quantitative Finance, and Venture Capital. I’ve worked on AI governance and Differential Privacy at The Cigna Group, won first place overall with my team in the UChicago Trading Competition, worked at an early stage blockchain Startup, and am currently conducting research on formal logic constraints and those applications to LLMs and NLP, a course assistant (teaching assistant) for Machine Learning, and implementing algorithmic trading models and strategies and different projects through my presidency at CU Quants. I love playing poker, skiing, practicing Muay Thai, and I’m deeply interested in exploring history, philosophy, health and wellness through nutrition and optimization, leadership, and storytelling.
